The general practice of controlling emerged weeds in arable fields consists of the uniform
application of a selective herbicide. This ensures a competitive advantage for the crop without
severely damaging it. However, the extensive use of herbicides in the last few decades has been
challenged by consumers as well as policy makers because of growing concerns regarding their
potential environmental impact on drinking water reservoirs, fauna in watercourses, etc.

This project makes use of a dataset with over 713 images of common chickweed. The project
seeks to propose a solution that uses a model to identify weed plants, make a leaf count of weeds
and classify them in groups in anticipation of application of a reduced herbicide dose system,
which maintains weed control efficiency.
